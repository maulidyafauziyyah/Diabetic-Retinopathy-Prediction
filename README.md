## Instructions

The project is to be done in a notebook format and model deployment with several criteria below:

1. The Deep Learning framework used is TensorFlow.

2. Visualization libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, or others are used.

3. The notebook content should follow the outline below:
   1. Introduction
      > This section provides an overview of the dataset used.

   2. Import Libraries
      > The first cell in the notebook contains all the libraries used in the project.

   3. Data Loading
      > This section contains the data preparation process before further data exploration. Data Loading processes may include renaming columns, checking the dataset size, etc.

   4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      > This section contains data exploration of the above dataset using queries, grouping, simple visualizations, and others.

   5. Feature Engineering
      > This section contains the data preparation process for model training, such as data splitting into train-val-test, preprocessing, and other necessary processes.

   6. ANN Training (Sequential API, Functional API, and Transfer Learning)
      
      vi.1. Model Definition
      > This section contains cells to define the model. Explain the reasons for using a particular algorithm/model, the hyperparameters used, the type of metrics used, and other model-related aspects.

      vi.2. Model Training
      > Cells in this section contain code to train the model and the resulting output.

      vi.3. Model Evaluation
      > In this section, model evaluation is performed, showing the model's performance based on the selected metrics. This is supported by visualizations of performance trends and/or error rates.

   7. ANN Improvement (Sequential API, Functional API, and Transfer Learning)
      
      vii.1. Model Definition
      > This section contains cells to define the model.

      vii.2. Model Training
      > Cells in this section contain code to train the model and the resulting output.

      vii.3. Model Evaluation
      > In this section, model evaluation is performed, showing the model's performance based on the selected metrics.

   8. Model Saving
      > In this section, the process of saving the model and other files related to the model creation is performed.

   9. Model Inference
      > The trained model will be tested on data not included in the train-set, val-set, or test-set.

   10. Conclusion
       > In this final section, conclusions reflecting the obtained results are provided.
